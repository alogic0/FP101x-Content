00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,529
You have always wanted to learn about
category theory or as mathematicians call it

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,690
generalized abstract nonsense. Now what
is category theory?

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,910
Category theory is the mathematicians way

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,470
to do object oriented programming or
design patterns. A category is simply

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:23,170
built from objects and morphisms and the
morphisms have to satisfy certain laws.

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,880
In particular when you have a morphism
from a to b

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,420
and another morphism from b to c, you
have to have a morphism

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,460
directly from a to c as well.

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,989
Let's take a step back and take this
category

10
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,180
and make categories as objects

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,309
so that we get this picture. Here we
have the

12
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:48,120
categories now as objects and we need to
have a notion of morphism.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,949
That morphism is called a functor and
the category is called

14
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,510
the category of small categories. If we
look

15
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,930
at the rules for functors, what we
recognize

16
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,710
is that the functor when applied to object
is really

17
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,000
a generic type and when it is applied
to morphisms

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,650
we see that it's the familiar map
function. We can take

19
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,670
yet another step back and look at
functors as objects.

20
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,840
And when we use functors as objects, we
need

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,159
again a notion of morphism and those
morphisms are called

22
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,479
natural transformations. And if we look
at that with our developer glasses

23
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,200
we see that natural transformations are
nothing more

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,380
than generic functions. And this category
by the way

25
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,880
is called the functor category. Again

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,479
the morphisms in the functor category,
these natural transformations

27
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,759
have to satisfy particular laws and

28
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,829
the usual way to write those is with a
commuting diagram like this.

29
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:54,799
So if you go from the top left to the
bottom right, you can go in two ways

30
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,369
and the law says that it doesn't matter
which direction you take.

31
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,049
Well, I know which direction you should
take.

32
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:06,200
You should come and do this MOOC.
See you soon

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,850
in cyberspace!
